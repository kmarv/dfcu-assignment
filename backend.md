  DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
  DB_PORT=3306
  DB_DATABASE=dfcu_hr

MAIL_PASSWORD=3d1132bf07cee1

```

####  Additional Services

- **Queue services**: The  application uses queues, you need run the queue worker:

  php artisan optimize
  ```

- Ensure your database server is running.
- Check for any errors in your application logs located in `storage/logs`.
- Use `php artisan config:cache` to clear and cache your configuration if you make changes to the `.env` file.
