Here’s a deployment guide for setting up and running a React application locally. This guide assumes you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### Local Deployment Guide for React Application

#### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed (you can check by running `node -v`).
2. **npm**: npm comes with Node.js; you can check its installation by running `npm -v`.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you are working with a repository, clone it using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-react-app.git
git clone checkout frontend
cd your-react-app
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required packages defined in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install || yarn 
```

This will create a `node_modules` folder and install all the dependencies your application requires.

#### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)

 create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following varaiable

```dotenv
REACT_APP_LOCAL_URL = http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
```

Make sure to prefix your variable names with `REACT_APP_` to make them accessible in your application.

#### Step 4: Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the local development server:

```bash
npm start 
```

By default, this will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`. You can view your application in your web browser at this address.

email : admin@gmail.com
password : passwoed
#### Step 5: Building the Application for Production (Optional)

If you need to create a production build of your application, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command creates an optimized build in a `build` directory that you can deploy to your web server.

#### Step 6: Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration) to access your React application.

### Optional: Configure Additional Services

- **Proxy for API Calls**: If your React app needs to call an API running on a different port, you can set up a proxy in your `package.json`:

  ```json
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
  ```

  This will forward any unknown requests (not found in the static files) to your API server.

- **Run Tests**: If your application has tests defined, you can run them using:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Dependency Issues**: If you encounter issues during `npm install`, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, and then run `npm install` again.
  
- **Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache if you encounter issues with seeing changes after reloading your application.

- **Error Logs**: Check the console for any error messages if your application is not working as expected.

### Conclusion

Following these steps, you should have your React application running locally. Adjust any steps as needed based on your application’s specific requirements. If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to ask!
